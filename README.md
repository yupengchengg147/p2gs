#TODO: 
1. relighting  
2. internal filling:  
    a. how to shade the filled particles?  how to define the "normal" proerties of the internal kernels?  
    b. still limititions of 3dgs-dr:  
    Relighting; No roughness built: (https://github.com/gapszju/3DGS-DR/issues/6); Observed multi-layer local minimum still exists.
